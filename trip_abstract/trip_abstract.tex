Trip dates: 7/21/11 --- 8/6/11
\end{flushleft}

Arrived at Geneva Friday 7/22/11. 
Checked in with CERN user office and did paperwork/training Monday 7/25/11. 

Through the week, worked with John Fox and the CERN BE-RF group (Wolfgang Hofle, Urs Wehrle) in finishing our work on assembling, testing and characterizing RF amplifiers for the MD measurements.

Machine measurement on Wednesday 8/3/11: installed amplifiers in the SPS tunnel. Conducted our planned measurement of exciting transverse modes in a single beam bunch.
Also observed the effect of our system on SPS beam dynamics using instrumentation in the CERN control center (CCC).

Measurement was a success; bunch excitation was visible and we are confident of further results with the next MD measurements on 8/17/11. Processing and analysis of data is ongoing.

Toured various CERN facilities (CCC, LHC point 4 beam instrumentation, SM18 test facility).

Visited SLAC ATLAS group --- met with Charlie Young and several of the summer students.

Left Geneva, returned to Stanford 8/6/11.
